# Let's Set Up a Basic Environment

Oh my God! It's way too tedious to reconfigure the environment every time I reinstall Linux. Is there a simpler and faster way?

Yes, my friend—there is! You can automate this with a Bash script.

## ⭐ Basic Requirements

Create a Bash script to set up a basic environment, including the following components:

- git  
- docker  
- Python 3  
- pip3  
- curl  
- Disable SSH password authentication and set SSH timeout to at least 10 minutes  
- Switch system locale to Chinese  
- Update all packages to their latest versions  

## ❗ Advanced Requirements

- Add some interesting features—for example: logging, support for multiple Linux distributions, ability to switch package repositories, or any creative ideas you have!  
- Host the script publicly (e.g., on GitHub), so it can be directly downloaded and executed via `curl`.
